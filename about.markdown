# Current
UX designer at Apple.

I enjoy taking large systems and breaking them down into smaller features that integrate and compliment each other. I value having a holistic perspective for how new features fit into an application's existing systems and UX. Collaborating with developers and engineers is very enjoyable. Having done quite a bit of development myself, I feel comfortable when I find myself in more technical and system-centric conversations with developers.

#### Character TD
Early in my Animation education, an interest in automating and extending tools started to grow. Leaning heavily on the technical side of Animation I quickly found my home in one of the more technical and lesser traveled roads: Rigging.

While riggers typically stick to joint chains, constraints, and skinning; I would take on most technical tasks that came through studios ranging from pipeline design, animation tools, partical effects, and more. While working on any of these tasks it was always important to understand the problem, know what the profile was for the user of the tool, and what the goals and non-goals were. I often took to building the systems and the UI simultaneously keeping a watchful eye for cluttered and compelex UI's.
